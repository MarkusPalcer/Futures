# Futures
A try to providing a functional way for task based processing

## Description
This project extends the [Reactive Extensions for .NET](http://reactivex.io/) by Futures.
Futures are monadic handlers to asynchronous operations that yield exactly one result or an error.
In this way they are similar than the Tasks which are provided by the .NET-Framework already, but the handling of Futures seems more natural when you are used to working with IObservables or JavaScript Promises.
